<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Kabir Singh</h3>
<p>This is a movie about a bully, an abuser of women, an alcoholic surgeon and a foulmouthed hothead.</p>

<h3>Secret Superstar</h3>
<p>Secret Superstar is a really super powerful, emotional coming of age film with a heartfelt mother-daugter relationship at its core.</p>

<h3>Udta Punjab</h3>
<p>It is a story of 4 people whose lives have been influenced by the drug menace very much in the northern state of Punjab.</p>
